        Hello my name is Vonoa Fiddlecord

    </p>
    <p>
        

        I was the only Apothacary in my hometown, studying medical plants and medicine for my entire life, under my mentor Zilmop.
        Then a strange, seemingly magical disease  swept through the town while I was gone on a journey to the next town.
        I came back and nearly everyone was dying. Zilmop was the third to die , I tried to save everyone else but i couldn't do more
        than ease their pain. Now I'm on the road seaching for answers.
    </p>

        I was able to meet a group of people and together we took a job from a man Named Hosea to escort his niece Vera,
        but on our journey we became trapped in a strange land called Barovia ruled by a vampire named Strahd.
